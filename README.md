# dotfiles
This is a collection of my personal dotfiles.

## Usage
To use my dotfiles, clone this repository in your home-directory, then use gnu stow to automatically create symlinks for the files.

Some already existent config-files should be backed-up and then the originals removed, so stow can create the symlinks.
